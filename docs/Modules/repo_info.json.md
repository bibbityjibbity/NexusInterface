# repo_info.json

`repo_info.json` file contains information about your module's source code repository and the related verifications.

You don't have to create `repo_info.json` file on your own. It will be created by Nexus team during the repo verification process and sent to you after the verification is done. You then need to include this file in your module before delivering to your users, or your users will not be able to install your module. See [Repository verification process](./repo-verification.md#verification-process) for more information.
