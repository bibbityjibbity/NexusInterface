# Nexus API Overview
-------------------------------------

Nexus provides several APIs to allow users and developers to easily interact with the functionality of the Nexus software stack. Each API is a logically grouped collection of methods that either interact with a specific part of the stack (e.g. ledger, registers), by functional area (accounts, assets, tokens), or by industry specific use case (supply, music).


## `Protocol`
The API server uses the `HTTP` protocol and supports both **`GET`** and **`POST`** request methods.  

The API's use **`JSON`** (JavaScript Object Notation) as their primary data transport mechanism for both input and output.  However the API server also supports URL encoded requests (**`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`**).   

## `Port`
By default the API server runs on port 8080. This can be changed by setting `apiport=xxxx` in your nexus.conf or starting your daemon with the `-apiport=xxxx` parameter.

## `Security`
The Nexus API uses the `HTTP Basic` authentication scheme.  This requires the caller to set an `Authorization` HTTP header with the value `Basic <credentials>` with the `<credendtials>` portion set to `apiuser:apipassword` and `base64` encoded. On the API server side the authentication is configured by adding `apiuser=<username>` and `apipassword=<password>` to the nexus.conf.   
**NOTE**:  If you wish to disable authentication entirely, you can do so by setting `apiauth=0` in your nexus.conf


The authentication mechanism is complemented by the implementation of `SSL` encryption (`HTTPS`).  By default the API server is started with SSL disabled.  To enable it, please add `apissl=1` to your nexus.conf   


## `Multi-user Sessions`
The Nexus API can be configured to run in multiuser mode, allowing multiple signature chains to be logged in and use the API simultaneously.  This feature can be enabled by setting `multiuser=1` in your nexus.conf (default off).  When multiuser is enabled, the initial login response will include a session ID value.  This session ID must be then be included in all subsequent API calls to endpoints that require a user to be logged in.

## `Endpoint`

Each API endpoint can be invoked through the following semantics:

**`<api>/<verb>/<noun>`**

e.g.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ledger/get/block
```

**NOTE**:  URI's are always in lowercase.

# `Verbs (actions)`
The following list of verbs are used throughout the Nexus APIs.  While the action is generic in nature (i.e. list, get, create), implementations of these actions will adhere to certain semantics or mandatory parameters regardless of the noun (resource).

* `list`
   - Retrieves a sorted list of objects or data
   - Sorting is always newest to oldest
   - Supported parameters:
     - `page` + `limit` (where the start point is known) *or* `index` + `limit`
     - `verbose` to indicate the verbosity of the data returned.  Values can be `default`, `summary`, or `detail`
     - `format` indicates the format of the returned data (where applicable). Values can be `raw`, `JSON`, `XML`   

* `get`
   - Retrieves a single object or piece of data
   - Supported parameters:
     - `format` indicates the format of the returned data (where applicable). Values can be `raw`, `JSON`, `XML`

* `create`
   - Creates a single resource / object
   - Supported parameters:
     - `format` indicates the format of the data being provided to create the item / object (where applicable). Values can be `basic`, `raw`, `JSON`, `XML`, and `ANSI C`
* `debit`
* `create`
* `transfer`
* `claim`
* `reverse`
* `buy`
* `sell`
* `login`
* `logout`
* `unlock`
* `lock`
* `subscribe`

# `Nouns (resources)`

Within each API endpoint, a noun is used to describe the resource or object upon which the action is taking place.  

The commonly used resources are described below:

1. `transaction` :

    A transaction is a cryptographic object that contains the contracts that operated on the registers.   
    It is indexed by an uint512_t, so any index used must be sanitized to this format.

2. `block` :

    A block is a cryptographic object that contains the transactions in a specific sequence of time.  
    It is indexed by an uint1024_t, so any index used must be sanitized to this format.  
    A block index is prepended with 0x to imply hexadecimal encoding.
    Base-16 encoding is all that is supported at present.
    Other forms of encoding may be supported at a later time (possibly base-58).

3. `account` :

    An account is an object register of the following types: trust or base.   
    It is responsible for holding the state of a user's account balance.

4. `object` :

    An object is a register with nType being REGISTER::OBJECT.
    An object is always parsed, and access to it's data members given.

5. `token` :

    A token is an object register of standard OBJECT::TOKEN.   
    It contains the domain parameters of a token such as supply or total number of significant digits.

6. `asset` :

    An asset is an object register of a specialized type.

# `Error Handling`

In the event that an API call results in an error, a JSON object will be returned with the following format:
```
{
    "error" :
    {
        "code" : -123,
        "message" : An error has occurred"
    }
}
```
