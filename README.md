## Build and Dev-server Instructions

To get started, you will first need to set up node.js (version 10 or higher) and npm (version 6 or higher) they come together as a package and can be found [here](https://nodejs.org). You will then need to clone into this repository, cd into the NexusInterface dir, run `npm install`, then run `npm run dev` and the dev server will spin up launching the app for you.

To test a production build run `npm run package` and navigate to the _release_ directory in the root of the project and install as you would any other program.

Or use the _BuildStandalone-{platform}.sh_ files that include cleaning out old builds.
